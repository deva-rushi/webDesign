        <li><i>I am Rakada Deva Rushi Kamidi, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems (Computer Software Engineering) at Northeastern University, with an expected graduation in May 2025. My studies focus on Program Structure and Algorithms, User Experience Design, and Database Management, providing a strong foundation for developing scalable systems and user-friendly web designs.

            I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Aditya Engineering College, completed in June 2022. This program enhanced my programming skills in languages like Java, C++, and SQL.
            
            As an Associate Software Engineer at A.P. Moller - Maersk, I utilized Reactive programming in Java to improve booking confirmation times by 40%. My internship as a Java Backend Developer further refined my skills in Functional Programming and Test-Driven Development.
            
            I am proficient in various programming languages and tools, including Docker and Azure Data Studio, which equip me to create efficient and effective applications.</i> </li>
